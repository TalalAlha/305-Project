## Problem

Many people find it hard to find an appropriatecar that fits their needs.
Many Specifications come to their mind like:

-What is budget?

-What is the year of production?

-How many people do it carry?

-What are the car issues?

## Solution

We planned to solve this problem by creating an app that takes the user specification. 
By entering his specification, the app will show him the cars found based on his choice 
and all the information needed including car common issues. This app will solve a major 
problem, and it includes local and global issues that everyone can get help using this 
app.
