## Problem

Many people find it hard to find an appropriatecar that fits their needs.
Many Specifications come to their mind like:

-What is budget?

-What is the year of production?

-How many people do it carry?

-What are the car issues?

## Solution

We planned to solve this problem by creating an app that takes the user specification. 
By entering his specification, the app will show him the cars found based on his choice 
and all the information needed including car common issues. This app will solve a major 
problem, and it includes local and global issues that everyone can get help using this 
app.

![Main Menu](https://github.com/TalalAlha/305-Project/blob/85c33038bdabc48db14262317b604183036bc97c/Menu.png)


You have two choices Server or Loacl.Choose local if you want to run the application locally and Server if you want to run the application using server/client.


![LocalInput](https://github.com/TalalAlha/305-Project/blob/85c33038bdabc48db14262317b604183036bc97c/LocalInput.png)

Lets choose local.
After you choose there are 3 inputs you have to put:

1- Car Year Model

2- Maximum price you will pay

3- Number of seats for the car

Now we will choose the second choice that will run the server on port 9000

Now we will go to the client class and run it. After running the client class it will show us the same choices like the local choices, but this time it is running of server.

![ClientResult](https://github.com/TalalAlha/305-Project/blob/85c33038bdabc48db14262317b604183036bc97c/ClientResult.png)
